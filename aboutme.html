        Hello, my name is Puranjay Bhargava. I am 18 years old; born and raised in Jaipur.
        I have always been interested in sports and gaming since I was a kid. My ultimate
        life experience was to go on a student exchange program to Australia for 15 days.
        Since we were the Covid- Batch, we never got to experience my last year of High
        School.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I consider myself positive and open-minded. I am passionately committed to learning
        and self-development so that I can consistently achieve better results. I am always
        looking for new experiences for the personal - professional growth challenges. My
        primary objective is to carefully coordinate my work encounter and continuously
        expand my design skills and knowledge in the field of interest.
